# Creating Zoning Maps Using Python & Pandas
This lab is to process data using python libraries -- geopandas and pandas and make the map public by Carto.
### Result
The link of the final map is [here](https://zhenliu26.carto.com/builder/c7e9535b-36de-4a5f-b0ce-485fc4079fb9/embed)

### Discussion
<b>What do you think of Pandas?</b> 
Pandas is a powerful python library to process array-like data. It is simple to do much time-consuming and repetitive work in the data processing. Pandas provide the functions to read the data in many common formats, like TXT and CSV, which makes the applications of the library easy and efficient. Also, the pandas are based on the NumPy library, which is also a common library in many fields. So, the output of pandas can be applied in various tasks, like big data analysis, machine learning, and data grabbing. Also, Pandas works well with many other data science modules inside the Python ecosystem, and is typically included in every Python distribution. 

<b>What do you think of using Carto as a way to publish your results?</b> 
Carto is easy to operate and the interface is friendly. Like ArcGIS Online, a cloud-based GIS software, both have free trials for the users. They both have the functions to share the results of maps on the internet. From the [website](https://www.g2.com/compare/carto-vs-esri-arcgis), The author collects feedbacks about Carto and ArcGIS. Carto gets more positive feedback on admin, setup, and use than ArcGIS Online. However, ArcGIS online can connect all products in ArcGIS, which means ArcGIS has a better ecosystem than Carto. I prefer to use Carto to share the results from my course work or use it in the presentation. When I work on some projects, I would like to store the data in the cloud in ArcGIS and make some interactive map applications in ArcGIS online.
